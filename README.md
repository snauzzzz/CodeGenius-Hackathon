This project leverages JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to visualize real-time Air Quality Index (AQI) data from key global cities. Utilizing the World Air Quality Index Project's API (https://aqicn.org/api/), the application dynamically fetches and processes AQI data, adhering to attribution guidelines. The data is rendered using Chart.js library in the form of an interactive bar chart, enabling users to explore current air quality levels in cities like New York, London, and Tokyo. The UI, designed with HTML and CSS, incorporates Unsplash images to enhance the user experience and promote awareness of clean air initiatives.
